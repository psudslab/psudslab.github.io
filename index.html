										<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Who Am I?</h2>
										<p>I am currently a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://ist.psu.edu/"><font color="blue">College of Information Sciences and Technology</font></a> 
											and a faculty co-hire in the <a href="https://ics.psu.edu"><font color="blue">Institute for Computational and Data Sciences</font></a> at <a href="https://www.psu.edu"><font color="blue">Pennsylvania State University</font></a> since August 2019. 
										I received my PhD degree from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, 
										the State University of New York at Buffalo in 2019. 
										My advisor was Prof. <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/DML/people"><font color="blue">Jing Gao</font></a>. 
										Before that, I obtained M.S. and B.S. from Dalian University of Technology in China.</p> 
										<p>My research interests broadly are data mining and machine learning, including healthcare data mining, deep learning, natural language processing, security, truth discovery and probabilistic graphical model.</p>

										<p><font color="red">Openings: I am looking for motivated students (including PhDs, masters, and interns) working in the area of healthcare data mining, machine learning, natural language processing, and vision-language . 
										If you are interested in joining my group, please send me your CV. </font></p>
